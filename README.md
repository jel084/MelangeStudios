# MelangeStudios

1. Want one continuous page (menu bar at top: about, contact, get a consultation) -> in the top left add a melange studio button that takes you back to the top of the page
2. Order:
- Selling points with icons and small descriptions (I think a carousel would be nice)
- An about us section (can probably just copy and paste from the website)
- Melange's mission and core values (probably 4)
- Meet your instructor
- Reviews section
- Get in touch (contact form)
- Google Map integration
